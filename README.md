# Loan Prediction Project

## Project Overview
The Loan Prediction Project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan approval for applicants based on their personal and financial information. This model can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions, improving customer service, and minimising risk.

- Applicant's income
- Loan amount
- Credit history
- Employment details
- Property area
- Education level
